# Assessment of the Respiratory System
- dyspnea
    - difficulty breathing
    - subjective observation from patient
        - onset
        - duration
        - precipitating factors
        - relief measures (positioning, medications)
        - cough
            - productive or nonproductive
            - harsh
            - dry
            - hacking
            - expectoration
                - color
                - amount
                - consistency
    - objective data
        - observations
            - respiratory rate
            - oxygen saturation
            - patient's expressions (fear of suffocation)
            - chest movements
                - equal expansion (unequal could be collapsed lung)
                - retractions on inspiration (late stage respiratory distress)
            - nasal flaring (late sign of respiratory distress)
            - skin color and turgor
            - see Adult Health Nursing, Table 9-1 Adventitious Breath Sounds (page 775, location 16032)
            - orthopnea
            - see Adult Health Nursing, Box 9-1 Signs and Symptoms of Hypoxia (page 775, location 16032)
                - apprehension
                - anxiety
                - restlessness
                - inability to concentrate
                - disorientation
                - decreased level of consciousness
                - increased fatigue
                - vertigo
                - behavioral changes
                - bradycardia
                - increased rate and depth of respirations (becomes shallow and slowed as hypoxia progresses)
                - elevated blood pressure (becomes lowered blood pressure)
                - cardiac dysrhythmias
                - pallor
                - cyanosis (may not be present until hypoxia advances)
                - clubbing
                - dyspnea
