# Common Upper Respiratory Diseases
- rhinitis
    - inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes
    - sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion
    - acute or chronic based on duration of signs and symptoms
    - acute
        - common cold (viral infection - rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are most common cause)
            - nasal congestion
                - engorgement of nasal blood vessels
                - swelling of nasal turbinates
                - pharyngitis - mildly sore (sratchy) throat
                - laryngitis - hoarseness
                - headache, malaise, chills, fever
            - complications
                - bacterial sinusitis
                - otitis media (vestibule infection)
        - bacterial infection
        - foreign body
        - rhinitis medicamentosa - drug-induced congestion
    - chronic
        - allergic rhinitis
            - allergic reaction from previous exposure of allergens (antigen detection) and antibody development
            - histamine release
                - reacts with histamine-1 (H<sub>1</sub> receptors)
                    - arterioles and capillaries in region dialate - edematous
                    - capillaries become more permeable; extracellular fluid accumulation - edema
                    - nasal (rhinirrhea), lacrimal (conjunctivitis), and bronchial secretions
                    - pruitis of palate, ears, and eyes
                    - can trigger acute asthma attacks for those with asthma
                - severe allergic reactions
                    - extensive arteriolar dilation
                    - hypotension
                    - flushed and edematous skin
                    - urticaria (hives)
                    - broncial constriction and possible spasms
                    - dyspnea
                    - copius amounts of pulmonary secretions
                    - copius amounts of gastric secretions
            - seasonal or perennial (year-round)
                - treatment is symptomatic
                - treatment can be prophylactic
                - without treatment
                    - thickening of mucosal epithelium
                    - loss of cilia
                    - loss of smell
                    - recurrent sinusitis
                    - recurrent otitis media
                    - growth of connective tissue
                    - development of nasal or sinus polyps
                        - aggravate rhinitis
                        - secondary infections
        - nonallergic perenial rhinitis
        - chronic sinusitis
        - deviated septum
    - rhinitis medicamentosa
        - overuse of topical decongestants causing rebounding nasal secretions
