# Treatment of Upper Respiratory Diseases

- common cold
    - tx limited to symptoms of rhinitis
        - and when present, pharyngitis and laryngitis
        - preventing spread to others
        - preventing complications secondary to primary infection
        - decongestants (sympathomimetic amines)
            - the most effective agent for nasal congestion and rhinorrhea
            - adverse risks for those with
                - diabetes mellitus
                - hypertension
                - ischemic heart disease
        - antihistamines (H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonists)
            - some benefit possible in older children, adolescents, and adults
            - paradoxical nervous system stimulation can occur in young children and older adults
            - urinary retention
                - caution if enlarged prostate
        - analgesics, antipyretics, expectorants, and antitussive agents
            - depends on presence of fever, pharyngitis, or cough
        - laryngitis
            - rest vocal cords
            - inhale cool mist vapor several times daily to humidify the larynx
            - lozenges and gargles are not useful - do not reach larynx
- allergic rhinitis
    - tx
        - identify allergen(s) - skin testing
        - avoid exposure - lifestyle modifications/restrictions
        - antihistamines
        - decongestants
        - intranasal corticosteroid antiinflammatory agents
        - saline nasal sprays
        - as tolerated, vigorous exercise
            - 15-30 minutes once or twice daily
            - increases sympathetic output, inducing vasoconstriction
        - mild allergic rhinitis tx with 2<sup>nd</sup> generation antihistamines
            - loratadine
            - desloratadine
            - cetirizine
            - fexofenadine
            - or, nasal corticosteroid alone (if moderate to severe, use in conjunction with 2<sup>nd</sup> generation antihistamine)
        - immunotherapy
            - if symptoms uncontrollable otherwise, or only partially controlled
            - or if complicated by asthma or sinusitis
- rhinitis medicamentosa
    - best tx is prevention
    - awareness of possibility is needed teaching
    - complete withdrawal with need to tolerate symptoms for a week or more
        - saline nasal spray can help moisturize irritated nasal tissues
        - nasal steroids can take several days to reduce inflammation and congestion
        - one technique is to have pt clear one nostril while continuing in the other
            - saline or corticosteroid nasal spray in untreated nostril possible
            - then complete withdrawal
