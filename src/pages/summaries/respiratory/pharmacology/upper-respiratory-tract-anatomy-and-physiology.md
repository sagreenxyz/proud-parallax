# Upper Respiratory Tract Anatomy and Physiology
- nose
    -functions (olfactory and respiratory)
- turbinates - increase surface area; dense with blood vessels - warms and humidifies air
- sinuses
    - goblet cells produce mucus
    - cilia in posterior two-thirds of nasal passages, sweep mucus towards nasopharynx and pharynx (expectorated or swallowed)
- nasopharynx
- pharynx
- tonsils
- Eustachian tubes
- larynx
- innervated by autonomic nervous system
    - cholinergic stimulation - vasodilation, secretory glands producing mucous and serous secretions
    - sympathetic (alpha-adrenergic) stimulation - vasoconstriction
- paranasal sinuses
- pharyngeal tonsils (lymphoid); known as adenoids when enlarged
    - immunoglobulins for defense of upper airway
- sneezing - physiologic reflex to clear nasal passages
- coughing - physiologic reflex to clear lower respiratory airway
