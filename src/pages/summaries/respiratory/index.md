## Key Terms
- Adult Health Nursing
    - adventitious - abnormal sounds superimposed on breath sounds; sibilant wheezes, sonorous wheezes, crackles, pleural friction rubs
        - sibilant wheezes - musical, high-pitched, squeaking or whistling sounds; rapid movement of air through narrowed bronchioles
        - sonorous wheezes - low-pitched, loud, coarse, snoring sounds; often only heard on expiration
        - crackles - short, discrete, interrupted crackling or bubbling sounds; often only heard on inspiration; air forced through passages narrowed by fluid, mucus, or pus; inflammation or infection of the small bronthi, bronchioles, and alveoli
        - pleural friction rubs - low-pitched, grating, or creaking lung sounds; inflamed pleural surfaces rubbing together during respiration; have patient hold breath - if rubbing sounds contine, could be pericardial friction rub instead
    - atelectasis
    - bronchoscopy
    - cor pulmonale
    - coryza
    - cyanosis
    - dyspnea - difficulty breathing; a subjective observation - only patient can accurately describe
    - embolism
    - empyema
    - epistaxis
    - exacerbation
    - extrinsic
    - hypercapnia
    - hypoventilation
    - hypoxia
    - intrinsic
    - orthopnea - abnormal condition in which patient must sit or stand to breathe deeply or comfortably
    - pneumothorax
    - stertorous
    - tachypnea
    - thoracentesis
    - virulent
- Pharmacology
    - rhinitis - inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes
    - sinusitis
    - allergic rhinitis - inflammation of the nasal mucosa resulting from allergic reaction
    - antigen-antibody
    - histamine is a compound derived from an amino acid called histidine that is stored in small granules in most body tissues. Its physiologic functions are not completely known, but it is released in response to allergic reactions and tissue damage caused by trauma or infection.
    - rhinorrhea - runny nose
    - decongestants
    - rhinitis medicamentosa - drug-induced nasal congestion; overuse of topical decongestants may lead to a rebound of nasal secretions
    - antihistamines
    - antiinflammatory agents
    - pharyngitis - mildly (scratchy) sore throat
    - laryngitis - hoarseness
    - otitis media - infection of the middle ear (vestibule)
    - conjunctivitis = watery eyes
