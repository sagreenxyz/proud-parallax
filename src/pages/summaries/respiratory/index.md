## Key Terms
- adventitious - abnormal sounds superimposed on breath sounds; sibilant wheezes, sonorous wheezes, crackles, pleural friction rubs
    - sibilant wheezes - musical, high-pitched, squeaking or whistling sounds; rapid movement of air through narrowed bronchioles
    - sonorous wheezes - low-pitched, loud, coarse, snoring sounds; often only heard on expiration
    - crackles - short, discrete, interrupted crackling or bubbling sounds; often only heard on inspiration; air forced through passages narrowed by fluid, mucus, or pus; inflammation or - infection of the small bronthi, bronchioles, and alveoli
    - pleural friction rubs - low-pitched, grating, or creaking lung sounds; inflamed pleural surfaces rubbing together during respiration; have patient hold breath - if rubbing sounds contine, could be pericardial friction rub instead
- atelectasis
- bronchoscopy

## Summary

### Anatomy and Physiology
- external respiration - breathing; exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between lungs and environment.
- respiratory system works with cardiovascular system to circulate oxygen and carbon dioxide.
- oxygen necessary for metabolism
- gases diffuse across cell membranes (passive transport)
- upper respiratory tract
    - nasal cavity
        - nose (air filtered, moistened, warmed)
            - nares - nasal openings
            - septum - separates nares
            - mucousa - warms, moistens air; secretes 1L moisture per day; smell receptors (Cranial Nerve I - Olfactory Nerve)
        - nasal turbinates and conchae - larger surface area (warming and moistening); cilia (filtering); nasolacrimal ducts communicate with upper chamber
        - paranasal sinuses (voice resonance); [sinusitis]()
            - frontal
            - maxillary
            - sphenoid
            - ethmoid
    - pharynx (throat); passage of air and food
        - nasopharynx (superior); eustachian tubes communicate with nasopharynx (to middle ear - vestibule)
            - pharungeal tonsils (adenoids)
        - oropharynx (posterior to mouth)
            - palatine tonsils
        - laryngopharynx (superior to larynx)
    - larynx
        - thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple; two fused cartilage plates)
        - cricoid cartilage
        - tracheal lumen
        - epiglottis - leaf-shaped cartilage protects larynx when swallowing
        - vocal cords
            - glottis - opening between vocal cords
        - trachea (anterior to esophagus)
            - C-shaped cartilaginous rings (open part is posterior to allow esophagus to expand); maintains airway patency; cilia sweep upwards (superior direction)
            - tracheotomy to create tracheostomy for indwelling tube
                - below larynx, therefore speech is physiologically impossible
- lower respiratory tract
    - bronchial tree
        - right and left bronchus (bronchi)
            - right bronchus is larger diameter and more vertical in descent (foreign objects tend to follow right bronchus)
            - left bronshus is smaller diameter and more horizontal in position
        - bronchioles
            - terminal bronchioles (alveolar ducts)
        - alveoli (alveolus)
        - pulmonary capilary (diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide)
            - surfactant - reduces surface tension; prevents collapsing (atelectasis)
- mechanics of breathing
    - thoracic cavity (sternum, ribs, thoracic vertebrae)
        - mediastinum (interpleural space)
            - heart
            - great vessels (proximal aorta, proximal superior and proximal inferior vena cava)
            - lungs (apex is superior, base is inferior at diaphragm)
                - right lung (three lobes)
                - left lung (two lobes)
                - pulmonary arteries (deoxygenated blood) - from right ventricle of heart
                - pulmonary veins (oxygenated blood) - to left atrium of heart
            - visceral pleura (serous membrane) deep to, and parietal pleura superficial to
                - pleural cavity (negative pressure)
                    - pleural effusion - when too much serous fluid is produced in pleural cavity; distended pleural space and pressure on lungs
                        - thoracentesis to remove fluid
    - respiratory movements and ranges
        - one respiration = one inspiration and one expiration
            - inspiration - 2 seconds
            - expiration - 3 seconds
        - room air (21% oxygen)
        - exhaled air (16% oxygen, 3.5% carbon dioxide)
        - normal respiration rate is 14 to 20 breaths/minute
            - 40 to 60 for newborn
            - 22 to 24 for early school-age child
            - 20 to 22 for teenager
            - rates are higher for women than men
        - assessment - perform without patient's awareness to avoid altered breathing patterns
    - regulation of respiration
        - nervous control
            - medulla oblongata
            - pons
            - chemoreceptors in carotid artery and aorta (carotid and aortic bodies)
                - oxygen level, carbon dioxide level, blood acidity
                - CO<sub>2</sub> is carried in blood stream as carbonic acid
                - CO<sub>2</sub> stimulates respiration
                - normal pH is 7.35 to 7.45
